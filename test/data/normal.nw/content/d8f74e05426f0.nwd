### Clunk checking computer for Incubots.



Clunk dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it didn’t look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state it was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment’s hesitation, he sat in the pilot’s chair. “Navcom, do you have a business directory?”

“Yes.”

“Run a search, please. All details on a company called Incubots.”

There was a brief pause. “Owned by Redge Muller. Incubots specialises in robot programming and advanced pilot training.”

Clunk looked relieved. “So that’s what Mr. Jerling has in store for me. When I questioned him on the subject he was rather evasive.”

“Humans tell lies about the most trivial matters.”
