### Hal takes a call from Jerling



Hal was pacing the Black Gull’s flight deck, ready to put his fist through the nearest wall. “What do you mean, you can’t call Jerling back? What do you mean you didn’t save his details?”

“I erased the record after you turned the job down.”

“So look it up again!”

“Negative, we can’t afford the search fees.” The Navcom hesitated. “Incidentally, it’s your move.”

“How can you think of a bloody chess game at a time like this?”

“You’re only saying that because you’re losing.”
